## How to play:

In this early version, there is only one command called 'fix' that tells
and aircraft to navigate to a navigation beacon.

You can see an aircraft's callsign and the navigation beacon it wants to go to.

Type the aircraft's callsign, 'fix', and the name of the fix you want it to go
to, then hit enter.
